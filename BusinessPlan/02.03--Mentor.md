02.03 Finding a mentor

Mentorship
Search out someone who is active in your industry and is seasoned, meaning that they’ve been around for a while and can provide meaningful guidance. There are many great retired resources who are happy to share their time and expertise – just make sure they stay current with the industry and can make suggestions that will help move your business forward and not become mired in outmoded ways of doing business. The big benefit is that you can learn from a mentor’s past successes and failures. He or she also may connect you with important resources and contacts. If you need help in identifying such a person, check out SCORE, which offers free counseling for startups; visit them in person at an office in your community.

When you approach your potential mentor, be clear about how often you expect to meet or talk. Down the line, you may mentor a beginning entrepreneur. Always treat your mentor as you would want to be treated.
