# Online Market Research

Do some basic market research by searching the Internet for the key words you would use to describe your business.
For example, if you're planning to sell snow cones, go to Google and type in phrases like "frozen drinks," "snow cones," and "ice cream." You may find that you're competing with slushy drinks, such as the Big Gulp. Are you okay with that...and do you feel that you compete with that? You also need to know whether the market segment you're targeting is growing. Think of the following trends gaining steam: locavores (people who eat only locally grown food), men's skin care, co-creation sites (online retailers who let clients customize their products), and a host of others. Business ideas in any growing area have potential.

# Primary Market Research

In addition to online research, you may want to conduct in-person research such as interviews or surveys. Try talking to people who buy your competitors' goods or services. Find out what they like and dislike, what they wish were different, and what would make them switch to something new. In the box below, identify who you believe are the biggest competitors for you and why you think so. (Surveymonkey.com is a great tool to use for this. More about this in Step 3: Developing Your Prototype.)
