2.5 - Joining Professional Organizations

# Trade Association Example

For example, if you’re going to open a restaurant, then you might want to join the National Restaurant Association (the less controversial NRA), as I did when I launched Nu-Kitchen. Another professional organization I joined was the Entrepreneurs' Organization (EO), an international network of entrepreneurs, whose recently launched Accelerators' Group fosters business development and networking among early-stage businesses.

# Google Searches

Google the biographies of people in similar businesses, and see if they mention membership in any organizations. Try searching online for “associations” plus the key words of your industry. Also try with “organizations and “leagues.” Go back to the LinkedIn account you started and search for professional associations that you can join.
