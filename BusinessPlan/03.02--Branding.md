3.2 Brand Guildeline (logo etc)

What would you have thought of Apple’s logo (an apple with a bite out of it) if the graphic designer had presented the concept to you for your own business? Too simple? Not descriptive enough? Someone had the foresight years ago to know that this stylized Apple would help attract customers, promote worldwide brand recognition, and inspire loyalty.

# What's in a Logo?

A logo is the visual identity of your product or service, and a reflection of your own personal values and style. With its unique combination of fonts and colors, your logo provides likely customers with an unconscious impression of, and an emotional connection with, your business idea. The logo will either be a stylized picture or a combination of imagery and words, typically the company name or its initials. The big guys, like Apple, may spend hundreds of thousands of dollars creating new logos, but you don’t need to do that now, since we’re still giving life to your business idea.

# Create Your Initial Logo

In the text box below, write a list of attributes that come to mind when you think about your business idea. Keep this list at hand while creating your logo. To get this initial logo – even just a working version for these early planning stages, consider Logonerds, which will create a logo for less than $50. This is really inexpensive for a logo. I’ve used Logonerds in the past.
