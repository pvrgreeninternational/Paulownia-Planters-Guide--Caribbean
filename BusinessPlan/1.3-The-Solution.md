1.3 The Solution

# The Nu-Kitchen Solution

With Nu-Kitchen, I solved a void in the market by developing an online solution that allowed customers to create their own customized meals and have those meals delivered directly to their homes. Everything related to their accounts could be managed online, 24/7, providing the ultimate in convenience.

# What's Your Solution?

Think about your own solution. Imagine the fan feedback from grateful customers:
"You knew just what I needed! My friends will thank me when I tell them about you!"
Consider how your solution is going to change the lives of your customers.
