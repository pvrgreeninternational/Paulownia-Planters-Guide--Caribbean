03.03 - Domain Name

Naming

Consider a domain name that has the same name as your business, if you’ve decided on one. The domain name should be easy to say, easy to spell, and easy to remember. Try to come up with a unique combination of two or three words. If you can’t use your business name, try to find something that is closely associated with the product or services you’ll be selling. Many of these names are still available, but note that most single-word domain names are already taken. 

Registering Your Domain Name

To actually register your domain name, you’ll need to buy it from a service provider. We’ve provided the names of several for you to consider next to this action item. Go to any one of these sites and type in your domain name to see if it’s available. If it is, you’re golden (if not, keep trying different variations). You’ll see a number of extensions to choose from ".com," ".net," ".org," ".biz," and so on. Make sure that you can get the ".com" extension. In today’s market, the ".com" still dominates. I usually also buy the ".org", ".net" as well. It’s up to you whether you want to buy the other name extensions as well.
